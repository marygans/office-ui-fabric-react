# @fluentui/react-focus

**React Focus components for [Fluent UI](https://fluent.microsoft.com/)**

These are not production-ready components and **should never be used in product**. This space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.

To import ReactFocus components:

```js
import { FocusZone } from '@fluentui/react-focus';
```

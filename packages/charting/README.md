# @uifabric/charting

**Charting components for [Office UI Fabric React](https://dev.microsoft.com/fabric)**

These are not production-ready components and **should never be used in product**. This space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.

To import charting components:

```js
import { ComponentName } from '@uifabric/charting/lib/ComponentName';
```
